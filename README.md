"# Rainfall_Prediction" 


Rainfall_Prediction is a comprehensive climate data analysis pipeline designed to forecast Indian rainfall patterns for 2050 using CMIP6 climate model data. Built primarily for climate scientists and policymakers, this application provides an end-to-end solution for analyzing precipitation data, generating interactive visualizations, and producing executive summaries for data-driven decision-making. The system allows users to upload NetCDF datasets, processes and analyzes rainfall trends (including extreme event indices), and exports results as multi-format reports. There is a special focus on the Indian monsoon, with spatial pattern recognition, region-specific insights, and uncertainty quantification.

Key Features
Upload and preprocess climate data clipped to Indian geographic boundaries.
Calculate standard rainfall indices and perform ensemble modeling.
Generate interactive maps and visualizations for rainfall changes.
Automated executive summary and policy report generation.
Export results in PDF, Excel, and JSON formats.
Demo mode with synthetic climate data for testing.
